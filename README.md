# LIBRADiff

Welcome to the LIBRA Hydrogen Transport Modeling project! This repository focuses on simulating hydrogen transport in the LIBRA experiment through advective flow simulation in a molten salt environment. The project utilizes the FeNiCS finite element library and FESTIM framework for modeling and simulation.

## Introduction

The LIBRA Hydrogen Transport Modeling project aims to understand and simulate the transport of hydrogen in the LIBRA experiment. The LIBRA experiment involves advective flow simulation in a molten salt environment. This project leverages the capabilities of the FeNiCS finite element library and the FESTIM framework to build and simulate the hydrogen transport model.

## Install

To run the scripts in this repo, install Conda and create a new environment with:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then activate the environment:
```
conda activate libra-transport-env
```

This environment will contain all the required dependencies.
