# LIBRADiff

Welcome to the LIBRA Hydrogen Transport Modeling project! This repository focuses on simulating hydrogen transport in the LIBRA experiment through advective flow simulation in a molten salt environment. The project utilizes the FeNiCS finite element library and FESTIM framework for modeling and simulation.

## Introduction

The LIBRA Hydrogen Transport Modeling project aims to understand and simulate the transport of hydrogen in the LIBRA experiment. The LIBRA experiment involves advective flow simulation in a molten salt environment. This project leverages the capabilities of the FeNiCS finite element library and the FESTIM framework to build and simulate the hydrogen transport model.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the simulation:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- FeNiCS (version X.X.X)
- FESTIM (version X.X.X)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
